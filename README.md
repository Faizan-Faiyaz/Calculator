# Calculator

This code creates a basic calculator with number buttons, operator buttons (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=). The JavaScript code handles the user's input, updates the display, and performs the calculations using the eval() function. The CSS file would style the calculator's appearance.
